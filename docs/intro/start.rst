Getting started
===============

In this introductory chapter, we shall create several simple systems to get more familiar with noosphere.

Installation
------------

If you can run ``python3`` and its program ``pip3`` (or ``pip``), then you may install noosphere with::

    pip3 install noosphere

Most importantly, this adds the ``nos`` command to your path so you may need to open a new terminal for it to work.
If you get a noosphere help message by running ``nos``, then proceed in this tutorial.
Otherwise, consult the `installation guide <installation.html>`_.

Task list example
-----------------

In this short tutorial, you will get your hands dirty by creating a small system for task keeping.
