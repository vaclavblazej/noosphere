# Work on this project

## Next todos

* write basic documentation and make it more structured
* check that type contains the attributes - type_type module
* consistency checking with versions in nodes - consistency module
* types may be composed via their parameter super[]
* consider how to make extensible primitive types - map coordinates, link, etc.
    * they should have a structure, as json is subset of strings
* consider adding 'any' type which is parent of all types
* namespaces - every node has namespace of 'where it belongs'

## Done in 0.1 -- currently worked on

* change types so that any entity may have more than one
* split type system into attr_type and type_type
* modules - system checks if it implements given module
* change parameters to ids
* change ids from int to alphanumeric
* finish type integrity checking
* add tests to check the code
* basic concept implementation

## Version 0.0

* at first, nothing existed
