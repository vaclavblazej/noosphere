Note taking
===========

We'd like to have an easy way to manage our notes.
Contrary to the first example, in this one we shall create the model manually.

Adding more capabilities
------------------------

Having note-taking in hand we may alter the system or extend it.
Perhaps the easiest system to add is the search capability::

    nos add search database.json

Try running the search manually from the command line::

    nos module search 'Learn' database.json

Open the web again and try the new search bar.
There is also a setting, where you may configure how the search works.
