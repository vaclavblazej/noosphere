## todos

* finish type integrity checking
* versioning - entries are backed-up automatically and it is easy to retrieve entries from a given time
* features - system checks if it implements the given features
    * system says which primitive types it supports
* namespaces - every node has namespace of 'where it belongs'
* consider adding any type
* consider making the type system more robust -- should those be defined as traits?

## uses

* writing logical explanatory texts
    * groupable nodes
    * linkable nodes
    * checkable of consistency
* todo list
    * nodes with todos
    * can be listed
    * can be marked as done
    * with deadline
* data structures
    * implementation of *fast* structures within the structure
* analysis of proofs
